# nlp-intro

Materials to my **Introduction to NLP** mini-course that I presented at a student club at school.
The material introduces concepts in NLP, and walks through a hands-on project that can graph sentiment analysis result of live tweets.

To follow through, simply start at the [Intro-to-NLTK.ipynb file](https://github.com/ptmphuong/nlp-intro/blob/master/Intro-to-NLTK.ipynb)
